<p style="font-size:18px">Taking over the entirety of Somerset House, the London Design Biennale explored big questions and ideas about sustainability, migration, pollution, energy, cities, and social equality. Visitors saw engaging and interactive installations, innovations, artworks and proposed design solutions - all in an immersive, inspiring and entertaining tour of the world.

<p style="font-size:18px">Considering the current situation of the world, Indonesian pavilion think this is a good momentum to talk about a historical past that promotes peace. The title of this pavilion is “FREEDOME”. It was conceived as a collaboration from Adi Purnomo, Bagus Pandega, and Irwan Ahmett, and was supported by artists/designers: Agra Satria, Fandy Susanto, Max Suriaganda, Savina Lavinia, Suyenni and Yola Yulifianti.
My part of the collaboration was to develop a VR experience that brought the visitor/user to the "Berdikari" satellite, an utopian space satellite brought by Indonesia 10 years after Afro-Asian Conference. </p>

<p style="font-size:18px">This VR installation is one of series of installation that will tell a story about Afro–Asian Conference and an information satellite named “Berdikari”, that was created as a fictional story of a speculative future of the Afro–Asian Conference. The "Berdikari" satellite emerge as an alternative story to the space-age rivalry between USA and USSR. This is a pavilion that we hope can represent the endless search of “independency”, “equality”, “humanity” and “peace”. </p>
