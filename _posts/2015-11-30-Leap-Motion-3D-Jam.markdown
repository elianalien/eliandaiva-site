<p style="font-size:18px">This is me and my fellow submission for Leap Motion 3D Jam. This application made by Unity 5, utilising Oculus Rift and Leap Motion for playing it. Its Strange is meant to be a relaxing and meditating game, because we always felt the dizzy with many lags in Oculus rendering, although I believe it related to our cheap GPU. So we make a game that doesn't need the player to be rush or require speed and agility. Our submission was posted leap motion competition <a href="http://blog.leapmotion.com/take-meditative-vr-journey-16-vr-demos/">recap</a>.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">this is the summary of our game: It’s a weird, weird, weird, weird world, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/labtekindie/">Labtek Indie</a> is down with that. “You are a wanderer in a foreign world where the only way to understand what’s happening is by not trying to understand it. Just enjoy the beautiful, out-of-this-world scenery where you can interact with alien florals and objects. Your left hand is an ancient spirit trapped in a tree branch. And your right hand is a funky incarnation of an amoeba with swirly, mesmerizing bubbles.” “Light up alien towers, grab underwater bubbles, and feed orbivorous plants for your enjoyment. Yes, orbivorous… Because they only eat orbs created by your hands.”</p>
